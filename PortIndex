Guile implements Scheme as described in the Revised^5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme (usually known as R5RS), providing clean and general data and control structures. Guile goes beyond the rather austere language presented in R5RS, extending it with a module system, full access to POSIX system calls, networking support, multiple threads, dynamic linking, a foreign function call interface, powerful string processing, and many other features needed for programming in the real world.} maintainers nomaintainer categories lang version 2.0.14 revision 0

It includes libavcodec, the leading audio/video codec library. The project is made of several components: ffmpeg is a command line tool to convert one video file format to another. It also supports grabbing and encoding in real time from a TV card. ffserver is an HTTP (RTSP is being developed) multimedia streaming server for live broadcasts. Time shifting of live broadcast is also supported. ffplay is a simple media player based on SDL and on the ffmpeg libraries. ffprobe gathers information from multimedia streams and prints it in human- and machine-readable fashion. libavcodec is a library containing all the ffmpeg audio/video encoders and decoders. Most codecs were developed from scratch to ensure best performance and high code reusability. libavformat is a library containing parsers and generators for all common audio/video formats.} depends_extract bin:xz:xz categories multimedia version 3.1.4 revision 0
