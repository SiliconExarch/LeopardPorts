# LeopardPorts
a local repository of ports that are configured for MacOSX Leopard and shadow newer incompatible versions of ports

This repository, like TigerPorts and SnowLeopardPorts, contains a repository of older or modified ports from MacPorts that work on MacOSX Leopard. In general, the vast majority of current ports in the MacPorts distribution will build and run without trouble on MacOSX Leopard. 

However, on occasion ports evolve beyond the capabilities of Leopard (in which case the last compatible version will be kept here), or ports must be modified to work on Leopard but the modifications either aren't appropriate for the main MacPorts distribution, or haven't as yet been accepted in the main distribution.

Your contributions are welcome to this shared effort.
